## I've added AT1_SF_run_with_pngs.tbz2 which is a html file, with links to SCOP and PNG plots of domain boundaries. WARNING When un-tarbz2ed the file (amongst the mess of others) AT1_SF_run_with_pngs.html will require ~6GB of free RAM to open in Firefox (other browsers such as Chrome might well consume more RAM).
