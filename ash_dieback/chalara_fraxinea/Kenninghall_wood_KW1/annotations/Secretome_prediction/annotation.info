#lines beginning with # are comments and will be ignored


required: "program,version,os,run_parameters,target,sources"

program: "The Chalara fraxinea secretome was defined using Pexfinder. Transmembrane domain containing proteins and proteins with mitochondrial signal peptides were removed using TMHMM and TargetP, repectively"
version: "SignalP2, TargetP 1.1 and TMHMM 2.0c"
#os the analysis ran on, one of linux, osx, windows will be sufficient
os: "linux"
##program options used, command line options will do here (take out filenames and program name etc)
run_parameters: ""

##database or reference sequences being annotated, should also be in crowdsource repository and should be described here with its repository address. See README for more info.
